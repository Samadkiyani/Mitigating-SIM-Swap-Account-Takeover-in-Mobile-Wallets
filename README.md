- ðŸ’» **Notebook (optional)** â€“ Demonstration of solution (if extended with code/graphs).  

## Key Takeaways
- SMS-based OTPs are outdated and vulnerable.  
- Phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn) is a stronger alternative.  
- Risk-based authentication + machine learning enhances fraud detection.  
- Device fingerprinting and behavioral biometrics add extra defense layers.  
- Forensic logging is critical for incident response.
